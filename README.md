MST Algorithm Comparison Project

This project implements and compares Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of weighted graphs.

Technologies used:
Java 23, Gson for JSON parsing, and Python (Matplotlib, Pandas) for visualization.

To run the program, execute the main class (MSTComparison).
It will process the input graphs, display results in the console, and save them into results.json.

All analysis and explanations are included in the report file in the project folder.
